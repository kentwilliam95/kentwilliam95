# Hi There! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Kent William and nice to meet you! i am a **Game Developer** with a **Software Engineering** background. Previously, I worked on mobile app development using **Xamarin**, and worked with **Microsoft SQL** and **Firebase databases**. Since graduating from university in 2019, I've been focused on Game Development. I enjoy working in this field because it's challenging, complex, and fun.

i consider my self as a **Generalist**, capable of handling various tasks, but Iâ€™m particularly passionate about **UI System**, and creating meaningful player **feedback** which includes sound and visual.

### What i'm going to Learn
1. Building robust audio systems for games
2. Exploring Unity **UIToolkit** for modern UI workflows

### Free Time
iâ€™m continuing to work on a simulation game with a Tycoon-style genre that challenges players to thrive in a dynamic economy, trends. Itâ€™s designed to be fun and educational.<br>
